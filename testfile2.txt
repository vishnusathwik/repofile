**Subject:** Time Sheet Reversal for Two Weeks  

Hi [Colleague's Name],  

As per our discussion, I created a time sheet for a random period but missed adding a note to reverse the time sheet for the two specific weeks. Can I add a note in a single time sheet to request reversal for both weeks?  

Also, since I have already submitted 40 hours for this week, I assume I need to submit a zero-hour time sheet. Please confirm.  

Thanks,  
[Your Name]
